# Quantum Noise Synth

A tunnel junction has an audio voltage signal across it which is a cosine function of time with amplitude x in kelvin units.  The noise is integrated in a narrow band around some microwave frequency and converted back into an audio signal which is then amplified.  The total fluctuations from the whole measurement system are characterized by a Gaussian random noise source with average amplitude z in units of kelvin referenced back to the plane of the junction.  The audio output of the whole system is denoted by p
