# Quantum Noise Synth

We are illuminating a tunnel junction with an AC audio signal of some frequency and amplitude.  This might be the 60 Hz pickup from an AC line or some other sine wave oscillator we connect across the tunnel junction. We measure the integrated power spectral density across some microwave band and output that as another audio signal.  We will now simulate the behavior of this synth in jupyter.  Real measurements can be compared with simulated ones to get temperature and noise temperature from real experiments.
